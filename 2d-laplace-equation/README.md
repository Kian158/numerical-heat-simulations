# 2D Electrostatic Potential Simulation with Point Charges

This Python project solves the **2D Laplace equation** numerically using the **Jacobi method**, simulating the potential field generated by fixed point charges on a square grid.

---

## Concept

The **Laplace equation** in 2D describes electrostatic potential in regions without charge:

∇²φ(x, y) = 0

By fixing high and low potentials at specific points on the grid, we mimic **positive and negative point charges**, then solve for the steady-state potential everywhere else using finite differences.

## Method: Finite Difference + Jacobi Iteration

- Discretize the 2D space into a grid of size `(N+1) x (N+1)`
- Initialize potential `phi` to zero everywhere
- Set specific grid points to fixed potentials (representing charges)
- Iteratively apply the Jacobi method to solve Laplace’s equation:
  ```python
  φ[i, j] = 0.25 * (φ[i+1, j] + φ[i-1, j] + φ[i, j+1] + φ[i, j-1])
