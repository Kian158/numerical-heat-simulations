# A collection of thermal and electric physics models, using a variety of numerical methods to approximate ODES and PDES.

- 1D heat diffusion (a rod with fixed boundary conditions)
- 1D laplace equation (a 2D plane with fixed upper and lower potentials)
- 2D laplace equation (an upgraded electrostatic model solving using the Jacobi method)
